This is Veer Jain's Personal Website, a fun little one-pager with some fun interactive "pages"
and a cool depth effect. 

The website should help give you more information as for who Veer is and why he is a great fit in the Software Industry.

The website is simple, fully responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
